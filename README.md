### CSS Presentation Layer Assignment

For this assignment, I created a home page for a food truck. Styling was done in CSS. Any styling in HTML is unintentional.

Elements I knew I wanted to include:
-Horizontal navigation bar
-Images
-Font size/style variation
-Dynamically updating location map

I used Normalize.css because I wanted to preserve useful defaults just in case over unstyling everything.
